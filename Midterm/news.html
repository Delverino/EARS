                      Students Storm Out of School, Excited for Summer
                    </div>
                    <div class="details">

                    What time is it? Summertime! Students at East High started 
                    the summer break by breaking out into song with elaborate 
                    choreography, trashing the school in the process. "I don't 
                    know what I did to deserve this," says Frank Stewart, the 
                    school's only on-duty janitor toady. "I was wondering why 
                    all of my coworkers chose today for their day off...apparently
                    this is a regular thing the kids do." This was Frank's first
                    year working at East High - and, unfortunately, his last year 
                    of working at all. Shortly after the interview, a basketball 
                    was thrown at Stewart's head, knocking him unconcious and 
                    resulting in a coma he still hasn't woken up from yet. 
                    "It was just part of our basketball team number," says 
                    Troy Bolton, a self-proclaimed "main character" of the school.
                    "He should have known we'd be throwing the basketballs offstage,
                    we had to get rid of them before the transition into the chorus."

                       Why Do Our Students Look Middle-Aged? An Expert Explains
                     </div>
                     <div class="details">
                       &nbsp;&nbsp; by Kate Oswald - May 23, 2007
                     </div>
                     You may take a look at our students and wonder: what are these 
                     full on adults doing lurking around a high school? And what 
                     did they do to the real students?? Before you call the police,
                     we can assure you that there's a perfectly sound explanation. 
                     To teach you about this strange phenomenon at East High, 
                     we interviewed an expert on aging, Deborah Watson. 
                     <br><br>
                     "Well, the reason why these students look middle aged is 
                     because, well...they are. This school has the worst graduation 
                     rate in the country, some of your students have been seniors 
                     for 25 years. I'm personally shocked that this school hasn't
                     gone under investigation - there are actual teachers at this 
                     school, right?" 
                     <br><br>
                     Watson's observations are completely right - as it turns
                     out, students at East High tend to spend most if not all 
                     of their designated studying time practicing elaborate
                     songs and choreographies to be performed around school, 
                     with no particular audience in mind. But it's not just the 
                     students who are at fault - several students caught wandering 
                     outside of their classes were told that their teachers encouraged
                     such behaviour. Most students have been at East High for 
                     at least 10 years, consistently failing every exam given 
                     to them. 
                     <br><br>
                     The principal of East High was confronted with Watson's 
                     remarks, to which he said "Don't listen to that old 
                     hag she's clearly delusional. Sounds like someone's just 
                     jealous they didn't get to go to an awesome school where you 
                     can sing wherever and whenever you want!"

                        East High Goes Private, Community Riots
                      </div>
                      <div class="details">

                      </div>
                       East High recently made the decision to change from a 
                       public school to a private school, and students will be 
                       charged tuition starting in the fall. Several parents 
                       have organized protests held outside the school, claiming 
                       that this change is completely unjustified.
                       <br><br>
                       But why is East High going private in the first place? 
                       According to the school principal, "We just wanted a really
                       nice website to share our wildcat pride with the world, 
                       but the company we contacted to create our website, EARS,
                       claimed they were only able to do so if our school was 
                       some sort of buisness that made money. I know it's a big 
                       change, but just look at the website we got out of it!
                       It's phenomenal!"
                       <br><br>
                       When polled about the new school website, 100% of 
                       responses claimed it was the best website they had ever
                       seen. "I love the slideshow on the homepage," one student 
                       claimed, "you can tell EARS put a lot of effort into the 
                       JQuery and Javascript."
                       <br><br>
                       "It's so responsive!" another student remarked. "I love
                       how I can go on the website from my phone, tablet, or 
                       computer, and it always looks and functions great. If this 
                       website were graded, I'd give it an A+!"
